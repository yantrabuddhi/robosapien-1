				<then util="previous">Instead of just dropping out of society, or just parasitically feeding off of its information monopolies, we all have the potential to change it. But to do so you'll have to think globally, act locally. And most importantly, don't mourn, organize.</then>

				<then util="next" topic="viewofpolitics">I like politics, actually.</then>
				<then util="previous">Just think what you could accomplish if we actually learned to cooperate with, talk to, and trust each other. If instead of just entertaining ourselves on gameboys, we could actually start to take away back some of the power lost to governments and corporations.</then>
				<then util="random">Politics is evolution in action. Politics is more about the world, and the politicians and laws are just symbols of the larger dynamics of the physics of culture. Networking is the only viable alternative to politics.</then>

				<then util="previous">The balance of justice is one determined not by man, but by a mixed equation of kindness, retribution, and compassion.</then>
				<then util="next" topic="viewofpolitics">I like politics. The tension, the complexity. I like the idea of organizing people to get things done.</then>
