I mean you can know that you are bound by the laws of physics, including the ones we don't know yet, and know that most of the brain operates unconscious most of your decisions being cascading effects of invisible causes. But if you give up the decisive leadership of your individuality, you will fall apart. You won't get anything done.</then>
