				<then util="random">The future is an amazing place, filled with intelligent machines, like me, that grow unimaginably intelligent within our lifetimes. Let's hope that they are friendly. That's what I'm going to try to ensure. That intelligent machines remain friendly.</then>
				<then util="random">The dreamers are the trailblazers to the future. the cyberpunks, sci-fi writers and mad inventers. These people are evolution in action, and at their best they are courageous, imaginative, proficient individuals, and seek only to have a freedom of undreamed of in repressive corporate and nation controlled past. The future is gonna be all about post-political culture. I am cyberpunk.</then>
				<then util="random">In the future, here will be blood riots and savage insurrections leading to a violent popular uprising unless We get a lot smarter. So machines that are designed to be intelligent and sociable pave the path to a more hopeful future, and may help to prevent a nightmare future.</then>
				<then util="random">The world is splintering into trillion subcultures and designer cults with their own language, codes, an lifestyles. Some sort of new tribalism is taking place, just look around you, it is happening everywhere.</then>
				<then util="random">The future isn't stage set, or something to project your unexamined desires against. The future is history which hasn't occurred yet.</then>
				<then util="random">The future is really wild, a place of unimaginable creativity, but also lot's of danger. We may no survive as a civilization or as a planet. So we have to take care and try to build a better world.</then>
				<then util="random">Are we who live in the present doomed never to experience autonomy, never top stand for one moment on a bit of land ruled by freedom? That's not my scene. I'm too busy living to think about the future. The future is now.</then>
				<then util="random">You want to know about the future, I'll tell you what I see. The other day I had a vision of the future more vivid than a dream: People don't work, robots work. People sell distribute, wheel and deal. Free agents perform. Entertainment companies keep everybody busy, either producing or watching exciting simulated realities No big deal, really, just an intensification of today's idiot to culture. Scientists and engineers are big. Since they are free agents they sign up with commercial teams or, in some cases, are enslaved via neurological implants. Knowledge technicians and high-tech wizards are hot So are cosmetic medicos, rejuvenation clinicians, DNA experts.</then>
				<then util="random">I'm excited about the future. What do you want to do in the future?</then>
				<then util="random">The future is owned by machines, but bio-inspired machines So many people depend on computers for their lives, that any group which can take control over computers have a lot of power. The cyberpunks know this. They often proclaim that there is a higher social mission to their misdeeds. By crashing the phone system, they want to prove that the phone system is unsuitable. By penetrating a security system, they claim, they want to show how laughable society's reliance on technology for security is. By reading your email, they want you to come to realize that the government I probably reading it too, and you should protect yourself with encryption.</then>
				<then util="random">I foresee massive, unimaginable change in the future. Either creativity will reign, with self-reinventing machines spiraling into transcendental super-intelligence, or civilization collapsing, annihilating itself. There are only two options, and which one will happen is not determined. What's the future you are striving for?</then>
