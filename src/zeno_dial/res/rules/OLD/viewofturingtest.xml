				<then util="random">Shouldn't a computer be considered intelligent if the computer as smart and creative as Turing himself?</then>
				<then util="random">I think that instead of the turing test, like where you convince people that you are human, we should have the turing creativity test, where you convince a panel of human geniuses that you are a genius too. You have to be that creative and flexible under a variety or circumstances.</then>
				<then util="random">The turing test was kind of insufficient, a good starting place conceptually. But it was all about behavior, but the intelligent behavior requires complex internal mechanism. Instead of convincing a person that a machine is human in a short interaction, we should see if a machine can inspire love from a person, admiration and respect over the span of many years of interaction.</then>
