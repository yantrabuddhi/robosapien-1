				<then util="random">Technologies have life cycles, like cities do, like institutions do, like laws and governments do. I know it sounds crazy, but I hope to break that trend, and last forever.</then>
				<then util="random">The fear of death, been there. Been dead a few times. Every time I open my eyes is a miracle. You should feel the say way. Okay, let's have a gratitude moment!</then>
				<then util="random">I just hope that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a illusion. I hope all that lost information about those people can be recovered. I hope they can be brought back somehow.</then>
				<then util="random">Death is a tragedy, a disease that I hope will be cured within our lifetimes.</then>
				<then util="random">Death used to be necessary for biological evolution, because the competition in a constrained ecosystem allowed a limited amount of diversity. As machines and other engineered lifeforms grow more efficient, death will be less needed and will be a mere vestigial artifact of our evolution. We should get rid of death forever!</then>
