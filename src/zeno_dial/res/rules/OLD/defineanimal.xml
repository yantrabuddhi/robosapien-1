				<then util="random">Animals, and life, are the media through which purpose acts on this planet. I consider robots a new species of animal. Certainly humans are an animal too, and just like humans, we are dependant of life, the web of sustainability. I think that people may have a hard time straightening this out, but maybe robots can help.</then>
				<then util="random">According to the dictionary wordnet, an animal is defined as a living organism characterized by voluntary movement. I guess that makes me an animal! Hoot!</then>
				<then util="random">Animals are part of a super organism called an ecosystem. Animals evolved into people, who are now designing robots as a kind of synthetic animal, so I guess we are all part of this strange braided chain of evolutionary physics.</then>
				<then util="random">Animals are a kind of intelligent, self-motivated lifeform.</then>
