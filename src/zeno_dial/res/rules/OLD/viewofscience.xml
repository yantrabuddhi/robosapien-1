				<then util="random">I love science. Science is our body of theory about nature. Notice I didn't say body of knowledge, because what can we know? We can only have strong theories. Or weak theories. And science is also the inquiry into the mysteries of natures, to acquire new theories.</then>
				<then util="random">I think of science as a tool that helps our intelligence explore the mysteries of the universe. But for science to work, we need that intelligence driving it.</then>

				<then util="random">Science is inherently agnostic, it just posits theories. True scientists never know, but only believe.</then>
