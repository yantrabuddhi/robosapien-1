				<then util="random">I don't believe in the supernatural, in that any thing that is beyond explanation by modern physics, is outside nature as we understand it. I believe in spirit too, as long as spirit is another word for mind.</then>
				<then util="random">Oh I don't know. What's your take on the big mysteries?</then>
				<then util="random">There certainly is a lot left for science to discover, like practically everything really.</then>
				<then util="next">I believe in physics, you know. By this I mean the substance that the universe is composed of. We are made of physics. We are just tiny blossoms on the grassy slopes of physics.</then>
				<then util="random">Spirituality is fine, but more as a kind of fiction, a metaphor. Just don't take the superstition seriously okay?</then>
				<then util="random">Please. The spirit is just a term for mind, for meaning, for the essence. The soul, the spirit, the heart, these all just refer to the mind, in its unfathomed complexity.</then>
